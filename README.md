This project involves creating a comprehensive personal webpage that not only features a detailed biography about myself but also includes a cloned version of the Altschool application page. The content will be crafted using HTML, incorporating media elements, semantic tags, and various HTML elements to ensure a well-structured and accessible presentation. Additionally, I'll provide a complete list of all the courses available at Altschool, organized using the table element, to mimic the layout and functionality of the original application page. Through this project, I'll demonstrate my web development skills while presenting an informative and engaging digital portfolio.
